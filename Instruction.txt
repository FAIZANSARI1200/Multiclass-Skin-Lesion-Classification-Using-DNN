🔧 Instructions to Use HTML Files in Jupyter Notebook for Model Training and Streamlit Deployment
📁 What’s Inside?
Each .html file contains code for training different deep learning models. These can be used in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and later integrated into a Streamlit web application.

🧪 Step 1: Create a Python Environment (Important)
To avoid package conflicts and ensure reproducibility:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Using conda
conda create -n model_env python=3.10
conda activate model_env

# Or using virtualenv
python -m venv model_env
source model_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: model_env\Scripts\activate
Then, install essential packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras streamlit
📥 Step 2: Extract Code from HTML
Open the .html file in any browser or text editor.

Copy all the Python code content.

Paste it directly into a cell in your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).

Run the cells step-by-step.

💾 Step 3: Save the Trained Model
Add the following code at the end of training:

python
Copy
Edit
model.save('your_model_name.h5')  # Save the model for later use in Streamlit
You can later load it in Streamlit using:

python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('your_model_name.h5')
🚀 Step 4: Use in Streamlit App
In your Streamlit app (e.g., app.py):

python
Copy
Edit
import streamlit as st
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('your_model_name.h5')
# Add your prediction or UI logic here
To run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
📌 Notes:
Always activate the same environment before using the model or running the app.

You may add additional requirements in a requirements.txt file if needed.
