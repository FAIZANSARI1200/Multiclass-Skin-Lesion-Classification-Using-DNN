# 🩺 Multiclass Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

This project involves the development of a deep learning-based web application to classify **7 types of skin lesions** using various DNN architectures. The system is designed to assist dermatologists, researchers, and users in early detection and categorization of skin conditions through image analysis.

## 📌 Objective

To build an accurate and efficient multiclass skin lesion classifier using multiple deep learning architectures, and deploy it as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
