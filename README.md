# Multiclass-Skin-Lesion-Classification-Using-DNN
Multiclass Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Learning &amp; Web Deployment This project focuses on classifying skin lesions into seven distinct categories using deep learning. I implemented and compared multiple architectures including ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, CNN + VGG16, ResNet50 + InceptionV3 hybrid, and a custom-designed CNN16 model.
